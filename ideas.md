  **Design Movement**: **Organic Modernism / "Clean E-commerce"**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Trust through Clarity**: Use ample whitespace and clear hierarchy to communicate the value proposition immediately.
  2. **Natural & Appetizing**: Emphasize the "fresh" and "healthy" aspects through color and texture.
  3. **Frictionless Conversion**: Make the path to signup obvious and inviting, not aggressive.
  4. **Tactile Quality**: Use subtle shadows and rounded forms to make the product feel physical and graspable.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Deep Forest Green (#2D5A27) - Represents health, nature, and reliability.
  - **Background**: Warm Cream (#FDF8F3) - Creates a softer, more inviting base than sterile white, mimicking oat milk or natural paper.
  - **Accent**: Energetic Orange (#F4A261) - Stimulates appetite and draws attention to CTAs without being alarming.
  - **Text**: Dark Navy/Charcoal (#1A1A2E) - High contrast for readability but softer than pure black.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Asymmetric Balance**: Use the "Jar" visual as a strong anchor on one side, balanced by typography on the other.
  - **Sectional Flow**: Distinct bands of color (Cream -> White -> Green Gradient) to guide the user down the page.
  - **Card-Based Features**: Enclose benefits and pricing in rounded cards to create distinct focal points.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Floating Jar Hero**: A high-quality, slightly floating representation of the product to create depth.
  - **Organic Shapes**: Use rounded corners (border-radius: 20px+) and potentially subtle wave dividers to break up straight lines.
  - **Iconography**: Simple, filled icons in the primary color to illustrate benefits quickly.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Hover Lift**: Cards and buttons gently lift (transform: translateY) to invite interaction.
  - **Smooth Scroll**: Navigation links glide to sections.
  - **Progressive Disclosure**: Information is presented in digestible chunks (e.g., the "How it Works" steps).

  **Animation**:
  - **Entrance**: Elements fade in and slide up as the user scrolls.
  - **Pulse**: The "Early Access" badge pulses gently to catch the eye.
  - **Float**: The main hero image has a slow, continuous float animation.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: Poppins (Bold/ExtraBold) - Friendly but authoritative geometric sans-serif.
  - **Body**: Poppins (Regular/Medium) - Highly legible, modern, and matches the headings for a cohesive look.

  **Design Movement**: **Neo-Brutalist / "Bold & Raw"**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Unapologetic Boldness**: High contrast, thick borders, and large typography to stand out in the crowded food market.
  2. **Raw Honesty**: Show the ingredients and the value without "fluff".
  3. **High Energy**: Use vibrant colors and sharp angles to convey the energy boost of the product.
  4. **Grid-Based Rigidity**: A strict, visible grid to emphasize the "structured" nature of the meal plan.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Acid Green (#4A7C43) - A brighter, more electric version of the brand green.
  - **Background**: Stark White (#FFFFFF) or Raw Cardboard (#E0D0C0).
  - **Accent**: Safety Orange (#FF5500) - For maximum urgency.
  - **Borders**: Thick Black (#000000) borders on everything.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Grid**: Content is compartmentalized into boxes with visible borders.
  - **Split Screen**: Hero section divided strictly down the middle.
  - **Marquee Text**: Scrolling text banners for announcements.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Hard Shadows**: Solid black drop shadows (box-shadow: 4px 4px 0 #000) for a sticker-like effect.
  - **Monospace Accents**: Use a monospace font for data points (calories, price) to feel like a receipt or nutritional label.
  - **Brutalist Icons**: Pixelated or very simplified line icons.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Instant Feedback**: Buttons depress instantly (no transition) on click.
  - **Hover Invert**: Colors swap (black on white -> white on black) on hover.

  **Animation**:
  - **Glitch**: Subtle glitch effects on hover.
  - **Marquee**: Continuous horizontal scrolling text.
  - **Staggered Reveal**: Elements appear one by one with a hard cut.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: Archivo Black or similar heavy sans-serif.
  - **Body**: Space Mono or Roboto Mono for that "functional" feel.

  **Design Movement**: **Soft Minimalist / "Wellness Tech"**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Calm Efficiency**: The design should feel as stress-free as the morning routine it promises.
  2. **Airy & Light**: Extensive whitespace to convey "clean" ingredients.
  3. **Sophisticated Palette**: Muted tones rather than high saturation.
  4. **Glassmorphism**: Use frosted glass effects to layer content over imagery, suggesting transparency.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Sage Green (#5F8D4E) - A softer, more muted green.
  - **Background**: Off-White / Alabaster (#F9F9F9).
  - **Accent**: Terracotta (#E76F51) - Earthy and warm.
  - **Glass**: Translucent white with blur.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Central Axis**: Centered typography for a classic, editorial feel.
  - **Overlapping Layers**: Images and text blocks overlap slightly to create depth.
  - **Full-Bleed Imagery**: Large, high-quality lifestyle photography as backgrounds.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Frosted Cards**: Background-blur on cards to let the underlying colors show through.
  - **Thin Lines**: 1px delicate borders.
  - **Serif Accents**: Use a serif font for "human" touches (testimonials, "Why JarFuel").

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Soft Fade**: Everything transitions with a slow ease-out.
  - **Parallax**: Background elements move slower than foreground content.

  **Animation**:
  - **Blur In**: Content blurs into focus.
  - **Slow Zoom**: Background images slowly zoom in.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: Playfair Display (Serif) for elegance.
  - **Body**: Lato or Inter (Sans) for readability.
